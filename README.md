# E-learning
A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic
resources is known as E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the
classrooms, the use of computers and the Internet forms the major component of Elearning.
E-learning can also be termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and
knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at
the same or different times. Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was
assumed that this system lacked the human element required in learning.
